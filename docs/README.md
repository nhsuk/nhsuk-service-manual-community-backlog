# NHS digital service manual community backlog

This is a place for teams building NHS or other health and care services to work together and develop the [NHS digital service manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk). 

## Working in the open

The community backlog lives on GitHub, in the open where everyone can see and get involved. 

It's grouped into 3 areas:

- [design system (styles, components and patterns) backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/1)
- [content guide backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/2)
- [practices and ways of working backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/3) - includes Accessibility guidance and the NHS service standard

## Working together

Join in with the community. It gives you a chance to:

- **collaborate** on developing solutions to common design problems
- **share** your work, insights and learnings with others
- **get help** with your own design and development challenges

## Ways to contribute

Anyone can contribute to the community backlog. All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to get started. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:

- [ask a question](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%E2%9D%93&template=ask-a-question.md&title=)
- [propose a new feature or improvement](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=new-feature.md&title=)
- [report a problem](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=report-a-problem.md&title=)

To feedback or share insights on something that already exists:

- find the issue in the community backlog - in the [issues list](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues) or [project boards](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects)
- add a comment to that issue

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to **open an issue or feedback as early as possible in the process**.
